# INTRODUCTION

In the first part is contained various dispositions of characters, by which powers the spirits or,
rather, the devils are invoked, to make them come when you will, each according to his power,
and to bring whatever is asked: and that without any discomfort, providing also that they are
content on their part; for this sort of creature does not give anything for nothing. In the first
part is taught the means of calling forth the Elemental Spirits of the [Air](/element/air),
[Earth](/element/earth), [Sea](/element/water-ingredient) or of the
[Infernus](/element/fire), according to their affinities.

In the second part are expressed the secrets, both Natural and Supernatural which operate by
the power of the Daemons. You will find the manner to make use of them, and all without
deceit.

In the third part is the Key to the Work, with the manner of using it. But, before starting this, it
will be necessary to be instructed in the following: There are three powers, which are [Lucifer](/demon/lucifer),
[Beelzebuth](/demon/beelzebub) and [Astaroth](/demon/astaroth). You must engrave their Characters in the correct manner and at the
appropriate hours. Believe me, all this is of consequence, nothing is to be forgotten.


# THE FIRST BOOK
## Concerning the Characters of the Daemons.

You must carry the aforesaid character with you. If you are male, in the right pocket, and it is
to be written in your own [blood](/ingredient/human-blood), or that of a sea-turtle. You put at the two half-circles the first
letter of your name and surname. And if you wish more, you may draw the character on an
emerald or ruby, for they have a sympathy for the spirits, especially those of the [Sun](/astrological_body/sun), who are
the most knowledgeable, and are better than the others. If you are a female, carry the character
on the left side, between the breasts, like a Reliquary; and always observing, as much as the
other sex, to write or have engraved the character on the day and in the hour of [Mars](/astrological_body/mars). Obey the
spirits in this, that they may obey thee.

The spirits who are powerful and exalted, serve only their confidants and intimate friends, by
the pact made or to be made according to certain characters at the will of Singambuth or of his
Secretary. Aabidandes, of whom we will give you information, is the perfect acquaintance to
call, conjure and constrain, as you will see in the Key, where you will be given a method of
making a pact with the spirits.

## Of the Nature of Pacts.

There are only two kinds of pact, the tacit and the apparent [or explicit]. You will know the one
from the other, if you read this little book. Know, however, that there are many kinds of spirits,
some attractive and others not attractive.

It is when you make a pact with a spirit, and have to give the spirit something which belongs to
you, that you have to be on your guard.

## The Kinds of Spirits.

In regard to spirits, there are the superior and the inferior. Names of the superiors are: [Lucifer](/demon/lucifer),
[Beelzebuth](/demon/beelzebub), [Astaroth](/demon/astaroth). The inferiors of [Lucifer](/demon/lucifer) are in Europe and Asia, and obey him.

[Beelzebuth](/demon/beelzebub) lives in Africa, and [Astaroth](/demon/astaroth) inhabits America.

Of these, each of them has two who order their subjects all that which the Emperor has
resolved to do in all the world, and vice-versa.

## The Visible Appearance of Spirits.

Spirits do not always appear in the same shape. This is because they are not themselves of
matter or form, and have to find a body to appear in, and one suitable to their intended
manifestation and appearance.

[Lucifer](/demon/lucifer) appears in the form and figure of a fair boy. When angry, he seems red. There is
nothing monstrous about him.

[Beelzebuth](/demon/beelzebub) appears sometimes in monstrous forms, sometimes like a giant cow, at times like a
he-[goat](/creature/goat), with a long tail. When angry, he vomits fire.

[Astaroth](/demon/astaroth) appears black, in human shape.

Here are three characters of [Lucifer](/demon/lucifer), outside his circle:
The following are those of [Beelzebuth](/demon/beelzebub) and [Astaroth](/demon/astaroth) placed outside their circles:
## To Invoke the Spirits.

It is only necessary, when you desire to invoke them, to call them by their characters, which
they themselves have given. And when you wish to invoke them, call them to serve you, in the
manner taught in the Third Part.

## Descending to the Inferiors.

[Lucifer](/demon/lucifer) has two demons under him: [Satanackia](/demon/satanakia) and [Agalierap](/demon/agalierap). Those of [Beelzebuth](/demon/beelzebub) are
Tarchimache and [Fleruty](/demon/fleurety). The characters of [Satanackia](/demon/satanakia) and [Fleruty](/demon/fleurety) are:

[figure]

The two inferiors of [Astaroth](/demon/astaroth) are [Sagatana](/demon/sagatana) and [Nesbiros](/demon/nesbiros), and their characters are:
There are yet other daemons, apart from these, who are under Duke [Syrach](/demon/syrach). There are eighteen
of these, and their names are:

I. [Clauneck](/demon/clauneck)  
II. [Musisin](/demon/musisin)  
III. [Bechaud](/demon/bechaud)  
IV. [Frimost](/demon/nambroth)  
V. [Klepoth](/demon/klepoth)  
VI. [Khil](/demon/khil)  
VII. [Mersilde](/demon/[merfilde](/demon/merfilde))  
VIII. [Clisthert](/demon/[clistheret](/demon/clistheret))  
IX. [Sirchade](/demon/[acham](/demon/acham))  
X. [Segal](/demon/segal)  
XI. [Hicpacth](/demon/hicpacth)  
XII. [Humots](/demon/humots)  
XIII. [Frucissiere](/demon/frucissiere)  
XIV. [Guland](/demon/guland)  
XV. [Surgat](/demon/surgat)  
XVI. [Morail](/demon/morail)  
XVII. [Frutimiere](/demon/frutimiere)  
XVIII. [Huictiigaras](/demon/huictiigaras)  

## These are the characters of fifteen inferior spirits:
[BUCON](/demon/bucons)  
[CLISTHERT](/demon/clistheret)  
[FRUCISSIERE](/demon/frucissiere)  
[GULAND](/demon/guland)  
[MORAIL](/demon/morail)  
[HICPACTH](/demon/hicpacth)  
[FRUTIMIERE](/demon/frutimiere)  
[HUICTIIGARAS](/demon/huictiigaras)  
[HUMOTS](/demon/humots)  
[KHIL](/demon/khil)  
[MERSILDE](/demon/merfilde)  
[MINOSON](/demon/minosons)  
[SEGAL](/demon/segal)  
[SIRCHADE](/demon/acham)  
[SURGAT](/demon/surgat)  

# THE SECOND BOOK
AGLA * ADONAY * JEHOVA

There are other daemons, but as they have no power, we shall not speak of them. The powers
of the eighteen above-mentioned ones are these:

**[CLAUNECK](/demon/clauneck)** has power over riches, can cause treasures to be found. He can give great riches to he who makes a pact with him, for he is much loved by [Lucifer](/demon/lucifer). It is he who causes money to be brought.

**[MUSISIN](/demon/musisin)** has power over great lords, teaches all that happens in the Republics, and the affairs of the Allies.

**[FRIMOST](/demon/nambroth)** has power over women and girls, and will help you to obtain their use.

**[KLEPOTH](/demon/klepoth)** makes you see all sorts of dreams and visions.

**[KHIL](/demon/khil)** makes great earthquakes.

**[MERSILDE](/demon/[merfilde](/demon/merfilde))** has the power to transport anyone in an instant, anywhere.

**[CLISTHERT](/demon/[clistheret](/demon/clistheret))** allows you to have day or night, whichever you wish, when you desire either.

**[SIRCHADE](/demon/[acham](/demon/acham))** makes you see all sorts of natural and supernatural animals.

**[HUMOTS](/demon/humots)** can bring you any book you desire.

**[SEGAL](/demon/segal)** will cause all sorts of prodigies to appear.

**[FRUCISSIERE](/demon/frucissiere)** revives the dead.

**[GULAND](/demon/guland)** causes all illnesses.

**[SURGAT](/demon/surgat)** opens every kind of lock.

**[MORAIL](/demon/morail)** can make anything invisible.

**[FRUTIMIERE](/demon/frutimiere)** prepares all kinds of feasts for you.

**[HUICTIIGARAS](/demon/huictiigaras)** causes sleep in the case of some, and insomnia in others.

Under [Satanachia](/demon/satanakia) and Sataniciae are fourty-five [or, according to other versions, fifty-four]
daemons. Four of these, the chiefs, are [Sergutthy](/demon/sergutthy), [Heramael](/demon/heramael), [Trimasael](/demon/trimasel) and [Sustugriel](/demon/sustugriel). The
others are of no great consequence.

These spirits are of great advantage, and they work well and speedily, in the case that they are
pleased with the operator.

[Sergutthy](/demon/sergutthy) has power over maidens and wives, when things are favourable.

[Heramael](/demon/heramael) teaches the art of healing, including the complete knowledge of any illness and its
cure, He also makes known the virtues of plants, where they are to be found, when to pluck
them, and their making into a complete cure.

[Trimasael](/demon/trimasel) teaches chemistry and all means of conjuring of the nature of deceit or sleight-of-hand.

He also teaches the secret of making the Powder of Projection, by means of which the
base metals may be turned into [gold](/metal/gold) or [silver](/metal/silver).

[Sustugriel](/demon/sustugriel) teaches the art of magic. He gives familiar spirits that can be used for all purposes,
and he also gives mandragores.

[Agalierept](/demon/agalierap) and [Tarihimal](/demon/tarihimal) are the rulers of [Elelogap](/demon/elelogap), who in turn governs matters connected
with water.

[Nebirots](/demon/nesbiros) rules [Hael](/demon/hael) and [Surgulath](/demon/sergulath). The former (Hael) enables anyone to speak in any language he will, and also teches the means whereby any type of letter may be written. He is also able to
teach those things which are most secret and completely hidden.

[Sergulath](/demon/sergulath) gives every means of speculation. In addition, he instructs as to the methods of
breaking the ranks and strategy of opponents. Subject to these are the eight most powerful
subordinates:

I. [PROCULO](/demon/proculo), who can cause a person to sleep for forty-eight hours, with the knowledge of the
spheres of sleep.

II. [HARISTUM](/demon/haristum), who can cause anyone to pass through fire without being touched by it.

III. [BRULEFER](/demon/brulefer), who causes a person to be beloved of women.

IV. [PENTAGNONY](/demon/pentagnony), who gives the two benefits of attaining invisibility and the love of great
lords.

V. [AGLASIS](/demon/aglasis), who can carry anyone or anything anywhere in the world.

VI. [SIDRAGOSAM](/demon/sidragosum), causes any girl to dance in the nude.

VII. [MINOSON](/demon/minosons), is able to make anyone win at any game.

VIII. [BUCON](/demon/bucons), can cause hate and spiteful jealousy between members of the opposite sexes.

# THE THIRD BOOK
The Invocation.

This is the Invocation:
HELOY + TAU + VARAF + PANTHON + HOMNORCUM + ELEMIATH +
SERUGEATH + AGLA + ON + TETRAGRAMMATON + CASILY.

This Invocation is to be made on virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment), with the characters of the Demon upon it,
which causes the intermediary Scirlin to come. For from this depend all the others, and it can
constrain them to appear in spite of themselves, as he has the power of Emperor.

## Orison : Preparation.

Lord God Adonay, who hast made man in Thine own image and resemblance out of nothing! I,
poor sinner that I am, beg Thee to deign bless and sanctify this water, so that it may be healthy
for my body and my soul, and that all foolishness should depart from it.

Lord God, all-powerful and ineffable, and who led Thy people out of the land of Egypt, and
has enabled them to cross the Red Sea with dry feet! Accord me this, that I may be purified by
this water of all my sins, so that I may appear innocent before Thee! Amen.

When the operator has thus purified himself, he is to set about the making of the Instruments of the Art.

## Of the Magical Knife.

It is necessary to have a [knife](/ingredient/knife) or lancet, of new [steel](/metal/steel), made on the day and hour of [Jupiter](/astrological_body/jupiter) with
the [Moon](/astrological_body/moon) crescent. If it cannot be made, it may be bought, but this must be done at the time, as
above.

Having achieved this, you will say the Orison or Conjuration following, which will serve for
the knife and lancet.

## Conjuration of the Instrument.

I conjure thee, O form of the Instrument, by the authority of our Father God Almighty, by the
virtues of Heaven and by the Stars, by the virtue of the Angels, and by the virtue of the
Elements, by the virtues of the stones and herbs, and of snow-storms, winds and thunder: that
thou now obtain all the necessary power into thyself for the pefectioning of the achievement of
those things in which we are at present concerned! And this without deception, untruth, or
anything of that nature whatsoever, by God the Creator of the [Sun](/astrological_body/sun) of Angels! Amen.

Then we recite the Seven Psalms, and afterwards the following words:

Dalmaley lamekh cadat pancia velous merroe lamideck caldurech anereton mitraton : Most
Pure Angels, be the guardians of these instruments, they are needed for many things.

## The Sacrificial Knife.

On the day of [Mars](/astrological_body/mars) [[Tuesday](/day_of_the_week/tuesday)] at the New [Moon](/astrological_body/moon), make a [knife](/ingredient/knife) of new [steel](/metal/steel) which is strong
enough to cut the neck of a kid with one blow, and make a handle of wood on the same day and
in the same hour, and with an engraver you engrave on the handle these characters:
Then asperge and fumigate it, and you have prepared an instrument for service when and where
you wish.

## The Manner of Asperging &amp; Fumigation.

First, there is the Orison which is needful on asperging, and it is thus recited:
In the name of the immortal God, asperge [N] and clean you of all foolishness and all deceit,
and you will be whiter than snow. Amen.

Then pour as the aspersion blessed water thereon, saying:
In the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy + Ghost, Amen.

These aspersions are necessary for every item of equipment; so also is the fumigation which
follows.

To fumigate, it is necessary to have a cruse, in which you place [coal](/ingredient/coal) newly kindled with a new
fire, and let it be well ablaze. On this you place aromatics, and when perfuming the article in
question, say the following:

Angels of God, be our help, and may our work be accomplished by you. Zalay, Salmay,
Dalmay, Angrecton, Ledrion, Amisor, Euchey, Or. Great Angels: And do thou also, O Adonay,
come and give to this a virtue so that this creature may gain a shape, and by this let our work
be accomplished. In the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy + Ghost, Amen.

Then recite the Seven Psalms which come after Judicum tuum Regida and Laudate Dominum
omnes gentes.

## Of the Virgin Parchment.

Virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment) can be made in many ways. Generally it is made of the skin of a [goat](/creature/goat) or a
lamb, or other animal, which must be virgin.

After inscribing on the blade AGLA, and having fumigated it, the [knife](/ingredient/knife) will serve you for all
purposes.

Remember that when you make the Sacrifice in order to obtain the virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment) from the
kid, all the instruments must be on the altar.

You make the baton [or Rod, staff] of the Art from [Hazel](/plant/hazel-tree) wood that has never borne, and cut it
with a single stoke on the day and in the hour of [Mercury](/astrological_body/mercury) [[Wednesday](/day_of_the_week/wednesday)], at the Crescent [Moon](/astrological_body/moon).

And you engrave it with the [needle](/ingredient/needle), the pen or the lancet, in the following characters:
The seal and character of [Frimost](/demon/nambroth) to be inscribed on the first Rod:
Then you make another baton of [Hazel](/plant/hazel-tree) wood, which has never borne, and which is without
seed, and cut it in the day and hour of the [Sun](/astrological_body/sun) [[Sunday](/day_of_the_week/sunday)], and on this you engrave these
characters:

The seal and character of [Klippoth](/demon/klepoth) is to be inscribed on the second Rod.

[figure]

This having been done, you say over your baton the following Orison:
Orison.

Most wise, most powerful Adonay, deign to bless, sanctify and conserve this batton so that it
may have the necessary virtue, O most holy Adonay, to whom be honor and glory for all time.

Amen.

## Of the Lancet.

It is necessary to have a new lancet, conjured and prepared like the [knife](/ingredient/knife) and sickle. Make it in
the day and hour of [Mercury](/astrological_body/mercury), at the Crescent [Moon](/astrological_body/moon). Now follows the method of Making the
Sacrifice of the Kid.

Take your [goat](/creature/goat) and place it on a flat surface, so that the throat is uppermost, the better to cut
it. Take your [knife](/ingredient/knife) and cut the throat with a single stroke, while pronouncing the name of the
Spirit you wish to invoke.

For example, you say:  
I kill you in the name and in the honor of [N]. . .

This is to be well understood, and take care that you sever the throat at first, and do not take
two strokes, but see that he dies at the first.

Then you skin him with the [knife](/ingredient/knife), and at the skinning make this Invocation:  
Adonay, Dalmay, Lauday, Tetragrammaton, Anereton, and all you, Holy Angels of God, come
and be here, and deign to infuse into this skin the power that it may be correctly conserved, so
that all that is written upon it may become perfected.

After the skinning, take well-ground [salt](/ingredient/salt), and strew this upon the skin, which has been
stretched, and let the salt cover the skin well. Before you use the salt it must have the following
Benediction said over it.

## The Benediction of the Salt.

I exorcise you, O creature of the [Salt](/ingredient/salt), by the God who is living, the God of all Gods, the Lord
of all Lords, that all fantasies may leave you, and that you may be suitable for the virgin
[parchment](/ingredient/parchment).

When this is finished, let the skin with the [salt](/ingredient/salt) upon it remain in the sun for a full day. Then
obtain a glazed pottery jar, and write these characters around it with the Pen of the Art:

[figure]

Get [quicklime](/ingredient/lime-chemical) and slake this with exorcised water, and put these in the jar. Whe it is liquid
place it in your goatskin, and leave it long enough for the hairs to peel off of themselves.

As soon as the hair is in such a condition as to come off with a touch, remove it from the jar
and peel the hairs with a [knife](/ingredient/knife) made from carved [Hazel](/plant/hazel-tree). The knife must have had these words said over it:

O holiest Adonay, put into this wood the power to cleanse this skin, through the holy name
Agason, Amen.

The skin, when peeled, may be stretched over a piece of new wood, and stones are to be placed
on the skin, so that they hold it down. These are to be stones from a river bank. Before placing
the stones, say the following Orison over them.

## The Orison of the Stones.

O Adonay, most puissant and all-powerful Lord, allow that these stones may stretch this skin,
and remove from them all wickedness, so that they may possess the required power. Amen.

## Of the Aspersion of the Water.

All water used in these experiments must be asperged, by saying this over it:

Lord God, Father, all-powerful, my refuge and my life, help me, Holy Father, for I love you,
God of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, of the Archangels and Prophets, Creator of All. In
humility, and, calling upon Thy holy Name, I supplicate that thou wilt agree to bless this water,
so that it may sanctify our bodies and our souls, through Thee, most holy Adonay, Everlasting
Ruler, Amen.

The skin is allowed to dry after this, and before quitting the spot, say over the [parchment](/ingredient/parchment):
Je, Agla, Jod, Hoi, He, Emmanuel! Stand guard over this parchment, in order that no spectra
may take charge of it!

When the skin is dry it may be removed from its wodden frame, blessed and fumigated, and then it is ready for use.

It is important that this must not be seen by any women, and more especially during certain
times of theirs [i.e., during menstruation], otherwise it will lose its power. It must also be
known that when you make and use this parchment, you must be clean, pure and chaste.

The operator is to say one Mass of the Nativity then, and all the instruments are to be on the
altar.

## Of Aspersion.

You take an asperser made with a bunch of mint, [marjoram](/plant/marjoram) and [rosemary](/plant/rosemary) which is secured by
a [thread](/ingredient/thread) which has been made by a virgin maiden.

The asperger is made in the day and hour of [Mercury](/astrological_body/mercury) when the [Moon](/astrological_body/moon) is at its crescent.

## Of the Perfumes.

These are to be wood of aloes, [incense](/ingredient/incense) and [mace](/plant/mace). As for the mace, this is all that you need for the circle, and over the perfumes is to be said the following Orison:

## The Orison of the Aromatic Perfumes.

Deign, O Lord, to sanctify the creature of this, in order that it may be a remedy for the human
race, and that it may be a remedy for our souls and bodies, through the invoking of Thy holy
Name! Agree that all creatures which may breathe in the vapor of this may have wealth of their
bodies and souls: through the Lord who has fashioned the time eternal! Amen.

## Of the Pen of the Art.

Take a new quill, and asperge and fumigate this in the same way as the other instruments, and
when you are cutting its points, say:
Ababaloy, Samoy, Escavor, Adonay: I have from this quill driven out all illusions, so that it
may hold within it with effectiveness the power needed for all those things which are used in
the Art: for both the operations and the characters and conjurations. Amen.

## Of the Ink-horn.

You buy a new Ink-horn on the day and in the hour of [Mercury](/astrological_body/mercury). At this time, also, these
characters are [to be] inscribed upon it:

JOD HE VAU HE + [METATRON](/angel/metatron) + JOD + KADOS + ELOHIM [SABAOTH](/angel/sabaoth).

Then newly-made ink is exorcised with this exorcism before being placed in the horn:
I exorcise you, Creature of this Ink, by the names Anston, Cerreton, Stimulator, Adonay, and
by the Name of He who created all by one word, and who can achieve all, so that you shall
assist me in my work, and so this work may be accomplished by my desire, and brought to a
successful end through the agreement of God, He who rules all things, and through all things,
omnipresent and eternal. Amen.

## Then the ink is to be blessed with this Blessing:
Lord God, Almighty, ruler over all and forever, Thou who dost cause to take place the greatest
wonders in Thy creations, deign to grant the grace of Thy holy spirit through this ink. Bless it,
and sanctify it, and impart to it a special power, that whatever we may say or do or desire may
be accomplished: through Thee, Most Holy Prince, ADONAY. Amen.

## The Preperation of the Operator.

When the implements are ready, the operator must prepare himself. This is first done by this Preparatory Orison:

Lord God, ADONAY, who hast formed man in Thine image, I, the unworthy and sinful,
beseech Thee to sanctify this water, to benefit my body and soul, cause me to be cleansed.

As he says this the operator is to wash his face and hands with the water that he is blessing.

NOTE: This water is to be used for washing the hands and feet, and know also and know and
know again that it is necessary and most necessary, to abstain three days from sin: and above
all mortally, however much the human frailty may be, and especially guard your chastity.

During the three days, study the book and during this time, pray five times during the day and
four times each night, with the following form:

Astrachios, Asach, Ascala, Abedumabal, Silat, Anabotas, Jesubilin, Scingin, Geneon, Domol:  
O Lord my God, Thou who art seated higher than the Heavens, Thou who art seated higher
than the Heavens, Thou who seeth even unto the depths, I pray that Thou unto me the things
which I have in my mind and that I may be successful in them: through Thee, O Great God, the
Eternal and who reigns for ever and ever. Amen. [Shah gives a note of a variation: "Astrocio,
Asath, a sacra Bedrimubal, Felut, Anabotos, Serabilem, Sergen, Gemen, Domos: . . ."]

All this having been done correctly, all that remains is to follow your invocations and draw
your characters and you do as follows.

In the day and hour of [Mars](/astrological_body/mars) [[Tuesday](/day_of_the_week/tuesday)] the [Moon](/astrological_body/moon) being at the crescent, and at the first hour of
the day—which is a quarter of an hour before sunrise—you will prepare a piece of virgin
[parchment](/ingredient/parchment), which shall contain all the characters and the invocations of the spirits which you
wish to produce.

For example, in the said day and hour, you will attach to the small finger of the hand (which is
the finger of [Mercury](/astrological_body/mercury) a [thread](/ingredient/thread) spun by a virgin girl, and pierce the finger with the lancet of the
Art, to get [blood](/ingredient/human-blood) from it, with which you form your Scirlin character, as is given at the
commencement of this book. Then write your invocation, which is that which follows.

## Invocation to Scirlin.

HELON + TAUL + VARF + PAN + HEON + HOMONOREUM + CLEMIALH +
SERUGEATH + AGLA + TETRAGRAMMATON + CASOLY.

You must write the first letter of your name where is the letter A [in the sign &amp; character of
Scirlin], and that of your surname where is the letter D. The spirit Aglassis, whose character it
is, is very potent to render you service, and will cause you to have power over the other spirits.

Make above the Character of the Spirit that you desire to come, and burn [incense](/ingredient/incense) in his honor.

Then make the conjuration which is addressed to the spirit that you want to cause to appear,
and burn incense in his honor.

## Conjuration for [Lucifer](/demon/lucifer).

Lucifer, Ouyar, Chameron, Aliseon, Mandousin, Premy, Oriet, Naydrus, Esmony, Eparinesont,
Estiot, Dumosson, Danochar, Casmiel, Hayras, Fabelleronthou, Sodirno, Peatham, Come,
Lucifer, Amen.

## Conjuration for [Beelzebuth](/demon/beelzebub).

Beelzebuth, [Lucifer](/demon/lucifer), Madilon, Solymo, Saroy, Theu, Ameclo, Sagrael, Praredun,
Adricanorom, Martino, Timo, Cameron, Phorsy, Metosite, Prumosy, Dumaso, Elivisa,
Alphrois, Fubentroty, Come, Beelzebuth, Amen.

## Conjuration for [Astaroth](/demon/astaroth).

Astaroth, Ador, Cameso, Valuerituf, Mareso, Lodir, Cadomir, Aluiel, Calniso, Tely, Plorim,
Viordy, Cureviorbas, Cameron, Vesturiel, Vulnavij, Benez meus Calmiron, Noard, Nisa
Chenibranbo Calevodium, Brazo Tabrasol, Come, Astaroth, Amen.

After having said seven times the conjuration addressed to superior spirits, you will see the
spirit at once appear, to do whatever you desire.

## Dismissal of the Spirit.

When you have written the conjuration on the virgin parchment, and have seen the spirit, being
satisfied, you can dismiss him by saying this:

Ite in pace ad loca vestra et pax sit inter vos redituri ad mecum vos invocavero, in nomine
Patris + et Filii + et Spiritus Sancti + Amen.

[Go in peace unto your abode and let there be peace between you and I, and be ready to come
to me when you are called, in the name of the Father + and the Son + and of the Holy Spirit +
Amen]

## Conjuration for Inferior Spirits.

OSURMY + DELMUSAN + ATALSLOYM + CHARUSIHOA + MELANY + LIAMINTHO
+ COLEHON + PARON + MADOIN + MERLOY + BULERATOR + DONMEDO + HONE

## Dismissal of the Inferior Spirit.

Go in peace, N., whence you came, peace be with you, and come every time I shall call you, in
the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy Spirit + Amen.

Then you will burn the characters, because they will serve only once.

## Another Conjuration.

I conjure thee, N., by the name of the Great Living God, Sovereign Creator of all things, that
thou appear in human form, fair and aggreeable, without noise or inconvenience, to answer
truthfully in all the interrogations that I shall make. I conjure thee to do this by the power of the
Holy and Sacred Names.

## Orison of the [Salamanders](/creature/salamander).

Immortal, eternal, ineffable and Holy Father of all things, who is carried by the revolving
chariot unceasingly, of the worlds which continually revolve: dominator of the Etherian
countries where there is raised the throne of Thy power: above which Thy redoubtable eyes see
all, and Thy holy ears hear allÑaid Thy children whom Thou hast loved since the birth of the
centuries: for thy golden and great and eternal majesty shines above the world, the sky and the
stars, Thou art elevated above all, O sparkling fire, and Thou illuminatest Thyself by Thy
splendor, and there go out from Thy essence untarnishable rays of light which nourish Thy
infinite spirit. That infinite spirit produces all things, and makes the mighty treasure which
cannot fail, to the creation which surrounds Thee, due to the numberless forms of which she
bears, and which Thou hast filled at the start. From this spirit comes also the origin of those
most holy kings who are around Thy throne, and who compose Thy court, O Universal Father!
O Unique One, O Father of happy mortals and immortals! Thou hast created in particular the
powers which are marvellously like the eternal thought, and from Thy adorable essence. Thou
hast established them over the angels, Thou hast created a third kind of sovereign in the
elements. Our cintinual exercise is to worship Thy desires. We burn with the desire to possess
Thee, O Father, O Mother, the most tender of Mothers! O wonderful example of feelings and
tenderness of Mothers! O Son, the flower of all sons! O Form of all forms! Soul, Spirit,
Harmony, and Name of all things, preserve us and we shall be blessed. Amen.

## Of the Pentacle and the Manner of Working.

I have put here the form of the [Pentacle of Solomon](/magic_object/pentagram-of-solomon) so that you may make the arrangements,
they being of great importance.

When you make your circle, before entering therein, it is to be perfumed with [musk](/ingredient/musk), [amber](/ingredient/amber),
aloes wood and [incense](/ingredient/incense). And for the perfume which you will need for the invocations, that is
incense alone.

It is to be observed that you need to have always a fire during invocations, and when you
perfume, this will be in the name of the spirit that you would invoke. When you are placing the
perfume on the fire, say all the time:

I burn this, N., in the name and to the honor of N.

It is to be remembered that you must hold the invocation in the left hand, and in the right a rod
of [elder](/plant/[elder-leaves](/plant/elder-leaves)), and a ladle and a [knife](/ingredient/knife) are to be at your feet.

When all this is ready, stand inside the circle. If you have companions with you, they are to
hold a hand one of the other. When inside, trace the form of the circle with the knife of the Art.

Then pick up the wands, one after the other, reciting the Fiftieth Psalm. When the circle is
complete, perfume and sprinkle it with [holy water](/ingredient/holy-water). Characters are to written at the four corners of the circle. There are generally four pentacles, one at each point of the compass; and the
spirit is prohibited specifically from entering into the precincts of the circle.

Then the invocations are to be repeated seven times. When the spirit appears, make him sign
the character which you are holding in your hand, which promises that he will come whenever
you may call him. Ask for what you think needed, and he will give it to you.

## Dismissal of the Spirit.

Let him go away in these words:
Ite in pace ad loca vestra et pax sit inter vos redituri ad mecum vos invocavero, in nomine
Patris + et Filii + et Spiritus Sancti + Amen.

[Go in peace unto your abode and let there be peace between you and I, and be ready to come
to me when you are called, in the name of the Father + and the Son + and of the Holy Spirit +
Amen]

## Rare &amp; Suprising Magical Secrets.

### The manner of making the [Mirror of Solomon](/magic_object/mirror-of-solomon), useful for all divinations.

In the name of the Lord, Amen. YE shall see in this mirror anything which you may desire. In
the name of the Lord who is blessed, in the name of the Lord, Amen. Firstly, you shall abstain
from all actions of the flesh, and also from any sin, whether in word or action, during the
period of time laid down herein. Secondly, you must perform acts of good and piety. Thirdly,
take a plate of finest [steel](/metal/steel), burnished and slightly curved, and with the blood of a white [pigeon](/creature/pigeon)
write upon it, at the four corners, these names: JEHOVA, ELOYM, [METATRON](/[angel](/angelic_order/angel)/metatron), ADONAY.

Place the [steel](/metal/steel) in a clean, white [cloth](/ingredient/cloth). Look for the new [Moon](/astrological_body/moon), in the first hour after the [Sun](/astrological_body/sun)
has set, and when you see it, go to a window, look devoutly towards Heaven, and say:
O Eternal, O King Eternal! God Ineffable! Thou, who hast created all things for the love of
men, and by a concealed decision for the wellbeing of man, deign Thou to look on me, N., who
am Thy most unfit and unworthy Servant, and look upon this, which is my intention.

Deign to send unto me Thine Angel, [Anael](/angel/anael) upon this same [mirror](/ingredient/mirror); he does command and order
his companions whom Thou hast formed, O Most Powerful Lord, who hast always been, who
art, and who shall ever be, so that in Thy name they may work and act with equity, giving me
knowledge in everything that I shall seek to know of them.

Now you are to throw down upon the burning embers a perfume. While you are doing this, say:
In this and with this, that I pour forth before Thy face, O God, my God, Thou who art blessed,
Three in One, and in the state of exaltation most sublime, who sits above the [Cherubim](/angelic_order/cherubim) and
[Seraphim](/angelic_order/seraphim), who will judge the earth by fire, hear me!
This is to be said three times. When you have done so, breathe three times upon the surface of
the mirror and say:

Come, [Anael](/angel/anael), come: and let it be thy agreement to be with me willingly: in the name + of the
Father, the Most Puissant, in the name + of the Son, Most Wise, in the name + of the Holy Spirit, the Most Living!

Come, [Anael](/angel/anael), in the terrific name of Jehova! Come, [Anael](/angel/anael), by the power of the everliving
Elohim! Come, thee, by the right arm of the mighty [Metatron](/angel/metatron)!

Come to me, N., and order thy subjects so that they may make known to me through their love,
joy and peace, the things that are hidden from my eyes.

When you have finished this, raise your eyes toward Heaven and say:
O most powerful Lord, who does cause all things to move in accordance with Thy will, listen to
my prayer, and may my intentions be aggreeable to Thee! O Lord, if it be Thy will, deign to
gaze upon this mirror and sanctify it, that Thy Servant [Anael](/angel/anael) may come thereto with his
companions, and be agreeable to me, N., Thy poor and humble servant! O God, blessed and
raised above all the spirits of Heaven, Thou who livest and reignest for all time. Amen.

When this is done, make the Sign of the Cross over yourself, and also on the mirror on the first
day, and also on the next forty and five days. At the end of this time, the angel [Anael](/angel/anael) will
appear to you, like unto a beautiful [child](/creature/child). He will greet you, and will order his companions to
obey you.

It does not always require as long as this to cause the [angel](/angelic_order/angel) to appear, however. He may come
on the fourteenth day, but this will depend upon the degree of application and fervor of the
operator.

When he comes, ask him whatever you may desire, and also beg him to come and do your will
whenever you shall call him.

When you want [Anael](/angel/anael) to come again, after the first time, all you have to do is to perfume the
[mirror](/ingredient/mirror), and say these words: Come, [Anael](/angel/anael), come, and let it be thy agreement --and the rest of
this prayer to [Anael](/angel/anael) as we have given you above, until the Amen.

#### Dismissing the Spirit.

When he has answered your questions, and you are satisfied with him, you must send him away
by saying this:  
I thank thee, [Anael](/angel/anael), for having appeared and having fulfilled my requests. Thou mayest
therefore depart in peace, and shall return when I call unto thee.

The perfume of [Anael](/angel/anael) is [saffron](/plant/saffron).

### Divination by the Word of [Uriel](/angel/uriel).

To succeed in this operation, he who makes the experiment must do all things which are told
herein. He is to choose a small room or place which for nine days or more has not been visited
by women in an impure state [i.e., during their menstration period].

This place must be well cleaned and consecrated, by means of consecrations and aspersions. In
the middle of the room there is to be a table covered with a white [cloth](/ingredient/cloth). On this is a new glass
vial full of spring water, brought shortly before the operation, with three small tapers of virgin
[wax](/ingredient/wax-ingredient) mixed with human fat; a piece of virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment), and the quill of a [raven](/creature/raven) suitable for
writing with; an inkpot of chine full of fresh ink; a small container of metal with materials to
make a fire.

You must also find a boy of nine or ten years old, who shall be well behaved and cleanly
dressed. He should be near the table.

A large new [needle](/ingredient/needle) is taken, and one of the three tapers is mounted upon it, six inches behind
the glass. The other two tapers should be positioned at the right and left of the glass, and an
equal distance away.

While you are doing this, say:

Gabamiah, Adonay, Agla, O Lord of Powers, aid us!

Place the virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment) on the right of the glass and the pen and ink on the left. Before
starting, close the door and windows.

Now stir the fire, and light the wax tapers. Let the boy be on his knees, looking into the glass
vial. He should be bareheaded and his hands joined.

Now the Master orders the boy to stare fixedly into the vial, and speaking softly into his right
ear, he says:

#### The Conjuration.

[URIEL](/angel/uriel) + SERAPH + JOSATA + ABLATI + AGLA + CAILA, I beg and conjure thee by the
four words that God spoke with His mouth to His servant Moses: JOSTA + AGLA + CAILA
+ ABLATI. And by the name of the Nine Heavens in which thou livest, and also by the
virginity of this [child](/creature/child) who is before thee, to appear at once, and visibly, to reveal that truth
which I desire to know. And when this is done, I shall discharge thee in peace and benevolence,
in the Name of the Most Holy Adonay.

When this conjuration is finished, ask the [child](/creature/child) whether he sees anything in the vial. If he
answers that he sees an [angel](/angelic_order/angel) or other materialization, the Master of the operation shall say in a
friendly tone:

Blessed spirit, welcome. I conjure thee again, in the Name of the Most Holy Adonay, to reveal
to me immediately . . . . (Here the operator petitions the spirit for what he will.)

Then say to the spirit:

If, for any reason, thou dost not wish what thou sayest to be heard by others, I conjure thee to
write the answer upon this virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment), between this time and the morrow. Otherwise
thou mayst reveal it to me in my sleep.

If the spirit answers audibly, you must listen with respect. If he does not speak, after you have
repeated the supplication three times, snuff the tapers, and leave the room until the following
day. Return the next morning, and you will find the answer written on the virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment), if
it has not been revealed to you in the night.

### Divination by the Egg.

The operation of the [Egg](/ingredient/eggs) is to know what will happen to anyone who is present at the
experiment.

One takes an [egg](/ingredient/eggs) of a black [hen](/ingredient/hen), laid in the daytime, breaks it, and removes the germ.

You must have a large glass, very thin and clear. Fill this with clear water and into it put the
egg-germ.

The glass is placed in the [Sun](/astrological_body/sun) at midday in [summer](/season/summer), and the Director of the operation will
recite the prayers and conjurations of the day.

These prayers and conjurations are such as are found in the [Key of Solomon](/grimoire/clavicula-salomonis), in which we treat
amply of airy spirits.

And with the index finger, agitate the water, to make the germ turn. Leave it to rest a moment,
and then look at it through the glass, not touching it. Then you will see the answer, and it
should be tried on a working-day, because these are spirits that will come during the times of
ordinary occupations.

If one wishes to see if a boy or a girl is a virgin, the germ will fall to the bottom; and if he (or
she) is not, it will be as usual.

### To See Spirits of the Air.

Take the brain of a [cock](/ingredient/rooster-1), the [powder from the grave of a dead man](/ingredient/grave-earth/) (which touches the coffin),
[walnut oil](/ingredient/walnut-oil) and virgin [wax](/ingredient/wax-ingredient). Make all [this] into a mixture, wrapped in virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment), on
which is written the words:

GOMERT KAILOETH, with the character of [Khil](/demon/khil).

Burn it all, and you will see prodigious things. But this experiment should be done only by
those who fear nothing.

### To make 3 Girls or 3 Gentlemen appear in your Room, after Supper.

It is necessary to be three days chaste, and you will be elevated.

I. Preparation. On the fourth day, as soon as it is morning, clean and prepare your room, as
soon as you have dressed. You must be fasting at this time. Make sure that your room will not
be disturbed for the whole of the ensuing day. Note that there shall be nothing hanging, neither
anything crosswise to anything else, no tapestries or clothes hanging, and no hats or cages of
birds, or curtains of the bed, and so on.

Above all, make sure that everything is clean in every way.

II. Ceremony. After you have supped, go secretly to your room, which has been cleansed as
already described. Upon the table there is now to be set a white [cloth](/ingredient/cloth), and three chairs at the
table. In front of each place, set a wheaten roll and a glass of clear and fresh water. Now place
a chair at the side of the bed, and retire, while saying this:

III. Conjuration. Besticitum consolatio veni ad me vertat Creon, Creon, Creon, cantor laudem
omnipotentis et non commentur. Stat superior carta bient laudem omviestra principiem da
montem et inimicos meos o prostantis vobis et mihi dantes que passium fieri sincisibus.

The three people, having arrived, will sit by the fire, eating and drinking, and will thank the
person who has entertained them. If you are a gentleman, three girls will come; but if you are a
lady, three yound men will be involved.

Then the three will draw lots as to whom is to stay with you. If the operator is a man, the girl
who wins will sit in the chair which you have placed by the bed, and she will stay and be with
you until midnight. At this time she will leave, with her companions, without having been
dismissed.

The two others will stay by the fire, while the first entertains you.

While she is with you, you may ask her any question, about any art or science, or upon any
subject at all, and she will at once give you a definite reply. You can ask the whereabouts of
hidden treasure, and she will tell you where it is, and how and when to remove it. If the treasure
is under the guardianship of infernal spirits, she will come herself, with her companions, and
defend you against these fiends.

When she leaves, she will give you a ring. If you wear this on your finger, you will be fortunate
at gambling. If you place it on the finger of any woman or girl, you will be able at once to
obtain your will of her. Note: The window is to be left open. You can do this experiment as
often as you please.

### To Make a Girl come to You, however Modest she may Be.

Experiment of a marvelous power of the superior intelligences.

Watch for the crescent or the waning [moon](/astrological_body/moon), and when you see it, make sure that you see also a
star, between the hours of eleven and midnight. Before beginning the process, do thus:
Take a virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment), and write on it the name of the girl whom you desire to come. The
shape of the parchment is to be as you see in this figure:
On the other side of the parchment, write MELCHIAEL, BARESCHAS. Then put the
parchment on the earth, with the part where the name of the person is written next to the
ground. Place your right foot upon the parchment, and your left knee, bent, upon the ground.

Then look to the highest star in the sky, while in this position. In your right hand hold a taper of
white [wax](/ingredient/wax), sufficiently large to burn for one hour. Then say the following:
The Conjuration.

I salute thee and conjure thee, O beautiful Moon, O most beautiful Star, O brilliant light which
I have in my hand. By the light which I have in my hand. By the air that I breathe within me, by
the earth that I am touching: I conjure thee. By the names of the spirit princes living in you. By
the ineffable name ON, which created everything! By you, O resplendent angel [GABRIEL](/angel/gabriel),
with the planet [Mercury](/astrological_body/mercury/), Prince, MICHIAEL and MELCHIDAEL.

I conjure you again, by all the Holy [Names of God](/ingredient/names-of-god), so that you may send down power to
oppress, torture and harass the body and soul and the five senses of N., she whose name is
written here, so that she may come unto me. Let her then be tortured, made to suffer. Go, then,
at once! Go, MELCHIDAEL, BARESCHES, ZAZEL, FIRIEL, MALCHA, and all those who
are with thee! I conjure you by the Great Living God to obey my will, and I, N., promise to
satisfy you.

When this conjuration has been said three times, burn the [parchment](/ingredient/parchment) with the taper. On the
next day, take the [parchment](/ingredient/parchment), put it in your left shoe, and let it stay there until the person whom
you have called comes to seek you out. In the conjuration you must say the date that she is to
come, and she will not be absent.

### To Make oneself Invisible.

Collect seven black beans. Start the rite on a [Wednesday](/day_of_the_week/wednesday), before sunrise. Then take the head of
a dead man, and put one of the black beans in his mouth, two in his eyes and two in his ears.

Then make upon his head the character of [Morail](/demon/morail).

When you have done this, bury the head, with the face upwards, and for nine days, before
sunrise, water it each morning with excellent [brandy](/ingredient/brandy). On the eighth day you will find the spirit
mentioned, who will say to you: "What wilt thou?"

You will reply: "I am watering my plant." Then the spirit will say: "Give me the bottle, I desire
to water it myself." In answer, refuse him this, even though he will ask you again.

Then he will reach out with his hand, and will display to you that same figure which you have
drawn upon the head. Now you can be sure that it is the right spirit, the spirit of the head.

There is a danger that another one might try to trick you, which would have evil
consequences—and in that case your operation would not succeed.

Then you may give him the bottle, and he will water the head and leave. On the next day--
which is the ninth--when you return, you will find the beans that are germinating. Take them
and put them in your mouth, and look at yourself in the [mirror](/ingredient/mirror). If you can see nothing, it is
well. Test the others in the same way, either in your own mouth, or in that of a [child](/creature/child). Those
which do not confer invisibility are to be reburied with the head.

### To Have Gold and Silver, or the [Hand of Glory](/magic_object/hand-of-glory)

Tear out the hair of a mare in heat, by the roots, closest to the nature, saying DRAGNE,
DRAGNE, DRAGNE. Then tie them into a knot. Now go out and buy, without dispute over
the price, a new pot of earthenware, which shall have a lid. Return to your house as fast as you
can, fill the pot with water from a spring, until it is not quite full. Place the knotted hairs in it,
cover it, and place it where neither you nor anyone else can see it, for there is danger in this.

After nine days, at the hidden hour, bring out the pot and open it, and you will find that there is
a small animal like a snake therein. This fill jump up. Then say: I ACCEPT THE PACT.

Do not touch the animal with your hand. Place it in a new box, which you have bought for this
purpose, and that withouth bargaining as to price. You must feed the creatue on [wheat](/plant/wheat)-husks
alone, daily.

When you need [gold](/metal/gold) or [silver](/metal/silver), place as much as you require in the box. Go to bed, with the box
at the side of the bed. Sleep, if you desire, for three or four hours. Rise, then, and you will find
that the money you have placed in the box has been doubled. But what you put first into the
box must be left in it.

If it is an ordinary-looking snake, you should not ask for more than one hundred francs at each
time. If, however, it has a human face, then you will be able to obtain a thousand francs each
time.

If you want to kill the creature, place in the box instead of its daily husks, some of the [flour](/ingredient/flour)
which has been used fo the consecration in the first Mass said by the priest. After eating this it
will die. Above all, do not omit anything, because this is not intended as a joke!

### Garters for Distances

Go out of the house, fasting; march to your left untilyou find a ribbon-seller. Buy one ell of
white [ribbon](/ingredient/ribbon). Pay what is asked, and drop a farthing (un liard) into the box.

Return home by the same route. Next day do the same, until you have found a seller of pens.

Buy one, as you bought the [ribbon](/ingredient/ribbon). When you are locked in your own room, write with your
own [blood](/ingredient/human-blood) on the ribbon the characters of the third line on the plan. This is the right garter.

Those of the fourth line are for the left. [These are presumably the planetary symbols in the
concentric circles of the plan of the Grimoire.]

When this is done, go out. The third day after, take your [ribbon](/ingredient/ribbon) and pen, walk to the left until
you find a pastry cook or bakery. Buy a cake or [bread](/ingredient/bread) for a halfpenny. Go to the first tavern,
order a half bottle of [wine](/ingredient/wine), have your glass rinsed three times by the same person, break in
three the cake or bread.

Put the three pieces in the glass) with [wine](/ingredient/wine). Take the first piece and throw it under the table
without looking at it, saying IRLY, FOR THEE.

Then take the second piece and throw it likewise, saying TERLY, FOR THEE. Write on the
other side of the garter the two names of these spirits with your [blood](/ingredient/human-blood). Throw down the third
piece, saying, ERLY, FOR THEE. Throw down the pen, drink the [wine](/ingredient/wine) without eating, pay the
cost and go away.

Being outside the town, take the garters, make no mistake as to which is the right and which the
left. This is important. Stamp three times with the foot on the ground, pronounce the names of
the spirits TERLY, ERLY, BALTAZARD, IRLY, MELCHIOR, GASPARD, LET US GO.

Then make your trip.

### To Make a Girl Dance in the Nude

Write on virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment) the Character of [FRUTIMIERE](/demon/frutimiere) with the [blood of a bat](/ingredient/bat-blood). Then put it
on a blessed stone, over which a Mass has been said. After this when you want to use it, place
the character under the sill or threshold of a door which she must pass.

When she comes past, she will come in. She will undress and be completely naked, and will
dance increasingly until death, if one does not remove the character; with grimaces and
contortions which will cause more pity than desire.

### To See in a Vision Anything from the Past or Future

The two N N which you see in the second small circle mark the place where you put your name
[see To Make a Girl Come to You...]. To know what you will, write the names in the circle
on virgin [parchment](/ingredient/parchment), before sleeping, and put it under your right ear on retiring, saying the
following orison:

### Orison

O Glorious Name of Great God the ever-living, to whom all things are present, I am Thy
servant N. . . . Father Eternal, I beg You to send me Thy Holy Angels, who are written in the
Circle and that they shall show me what I want to know, by Jesus Christ our Lord. So be it
Having completed the orison, lie down on your right side, and you will see in a dream that
which you desire to know.

### To Nail (an Enemy)
Go to a cemetery, remove a nail from an old coffin, saying:  
Nails, I take you, so that you may serve to turn aside and cause evil to all persons whom I will.

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen..

When you wish to use it, you must look for a footprint and making the three figures of
[GULAND](/demon/guland), [SURGAT](/demon/surgat) and [MORAIL](/demon/morail), fix the nail in the middle saying:  
Pater noster upto in terra [our father who art on earth]

Hit the nail with a stone, saying:  
Curse evil to N . . ., until I remove thee.

Re-cover the place with a little dust, and remember it well, because one cannot remove the evil
which this causes, but by removing the nail, and saying:
I remove thee, so that the evil which thou has caused to N..., shall cease. In the Name of the
Father, and of the Son. and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Then take the nail out, and efface the characters: not with the same hand as you make them, but
with the other. Thus it will be without danger.

## FIN
