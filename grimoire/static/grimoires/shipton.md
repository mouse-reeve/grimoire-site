## THE NORWOOD GIPSY;
### Foretelling fortune by lines in the hand.

Observe always to choose the left hand, as the heart and
brain have more influence over it than the right hand! and
it is also better to examine them when in good health,
for then they appear full.

The reader will see that the principal line is the line of
life; if this is clear, and ends without breaks, it denotes a
happy old age and great prosperity. Round lines, like
semicircles, on the insides of the tips of the fingers, promise
houses, land and inheritance. As many lines or crosses as
a woman has in her wrist, so many children may she expect
to have. If the middle, or table line in the hand, is
very narrow and contracted, it is a sign of crosses and poverty.
If a crooked line goes through the table line, it is
a sign of death by accident or violence; but if it is straight
and even, it is a good sign. The natural line takes its
beginning from the rising of the middle finger.

The table line, commonly called 'The line of fortune',
begins under the little finger, and ends near the fore finger

The line of death is a counter line to that of life; by
some called the sister line.

The girdle of [Venus](/astrological_body/venus) (a circular line so called), begins
near the joint of the fore finger, and ends in the middle
finger. There are also lines in the fleshy parts, as in the
ball of the thumb, which is called ‘The mount of Venus’,
these are each governed by their several planets, and the
hollow of the hand, is the place of [Mars](/astrological_body/mars).

If the line from the wrist goes straight up to the little
finger, it is a better sign than if broken; for then the party
will live to a good old age: but on the contrary, should the
line want continuity, it denotes sudden death.

If the line which is in the middle of the hand, called the
table line be broad and fair, without being broken, it is a
sure sign the party will lead a happy life.

## The Signification of MOLES.
A mole on the right side of the forehead, or temple
signifies the person will arrive at sudden wealth and honor.

A mole on the right eyebrow foretells speedy marriage, the
husband to possess good qualities and a large fortune

A mole on the left side of either of those three places
portends disappointment in your most sanguine wishes.

by marriage.

man will be of a warm disposition and unsettled in mind.
In a lady, it shows sincerity in love, and easy travail in child-birth.

the person to be pusillanimous, and slow of understanding.

## Egyptian Charms and Cerimonies.

### [The Charm of St. Catherine.](/spell/charm-of-st-catherine)

This day falls on the 25th of November, and must be
thus celebrated: --Let any number of young women not
exceeding seven or less than three, assemble in a room,
where they are sure to be safe from interlopers, just as the
clock strikes eleven at night, take from your bosom a sprig
of [myrtle](/plant/myrtle), which you must have worn there all day, and
fold it up in a piece of tissue paper, then light up a small
chaffing dish of [charcoal](/ingredient/coal), and on it each maiden thrown in
hairs from her head, and a pairing of her toe and fingernails,
then let each sprinkle a small quantity of myrtle and [frankincence](/ingredient/frankincense)
on the charcoal, and while the odoriferous vapor rises,
fumigate your myrtle, (this plant or tree is consecrated to [Venus](/astrological_body/venus),)
with it. Go to bed while the clock is striking twelve,
and place the myrtle exactly under your head, and you
will be sure to dream of your future husband. Observe,
it is no manner of use trying this charm if you are not
a real virgin, and the mystic hour of performance must
be past in strict silence.

### [A Curious Spell.](/spell/how-to-make-your-lover-or-sweetheart-come)
If a maid wishes to see her lover, let her take the following
method: --Prick the third or wedding finger of your left
hand with a sharp [needle](/ingredient/needle), (beware of a pin,) and with
the [blood](/ingredient/human-blood) write your own and lovers name on a piece of clean
writing [paper](/ingredient/paper), in as small a compass as you can, and encircle
it with three rings of the same crimson stream, fold it
up and exactly at the ninth hour of the evening, bury it
with your own hand, in the earth, secretly. Your lover will
hasten to you as soon as possible, he will not be able
to rest till he sees you; and if you have quarrelled, to make
it up. A young man may also try this charm, only instead
of the wedding finger, let him pierce his left thumb.

### [Apple Parings.](/spell/apple-parings)
On the 28th of October, which is a double Saintsday,
take an [apple](/plant/apple), pare it whole, and take the paring in your
right hand, and standing in the middle of the room, say
the following verse:--

> St. Simon and Jude, on you I intrude,  
> By this paring I hold to discover,  
> Without any delay, to tell me this day  
> The first letter of my true lover,

Turn round three times, and cast the paring over your
left shoulder, and it will form the first letter of
your future husband’s surname, but if the paring breaks into
many pieces so that no letter is discernable, you will never marry;
unless you take the pips of the same apples, put them in spring water and drink the water at bed-time.

### [A Charm for Dreaming.](/spell/a-charm-for-dreaming)
When you go to bed, place under your pillow is common
prayer-book, open it at the part of the Matrimonial
service, in which is printed “with this ring I thee wed,” &amp;c.,
place on it a key, a [ring](/ingredient/ring-ingredient), a flower and a sprig of willow, a
small heart cake, a crust of [bread](/ingredient/bread), and the following cards:
the ten of clubs, nine of hearts, ace of spades, and the ace
of diamonds, wrap all these round in a [handkerchief](/ingredient/handkerchief) of thin
gauze or [muslin](/ingredient/muslin), on getting into bed cross your hands and
say:--

> Luna ever womans’ friend,  
> To me thy goodness condescend;  
> Let me this night in visions see,  
> Emblems of my destiny.

If you dream of storms, trouble will betide you; if the
storm ends in a fine calm, so will your fate; if of a ring, or
of the ace of diamonds, marriage; bread, an industrious life;
cake, a prosperous life; flowers, joy; willow, treachery in
love; spades, death; diamonds, money; clubs, a foreign land;
hearts, illegitimate children; keys, that you will rise to
great trust and power, and never know want; birds, that you will
have many children; geese, you will marry more than once.

### [Another charm for dreaming,](/spell/another-charm-for-dreaming)
is as follows,--

At the first appearance of the new [moon](/astrological_body/moon), immediately after
New year’s day, go out in the evening and whilst leaning on
a gate or stile, look up at the moon; and repeat the following lines, --

> All hail to the moon!  
> Display unto me  
> In a vision this night, 
> Who my husband may be.
